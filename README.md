# [buymacbookfor `AnyOne`](https://Tax0787.github.io/buymacbookfor--AnyOne)
I Used [MyHtml](https://github.com/Tax0787/MyHtml)

## How To Use?

It's an FW, It's work by `option.json` It's JSON file

This [example](https://sasak2.github.io/buymacbookforsasak2) shows how to automatically create the [original](https://github.com/sasak2/buymacbookforsasak2) [author](https://github.com/sasak2)'s great repository

For `사석이`, make [buymacbookfor `AnyOne`](https://github.com/Tax0787/buymacbookfor--AnyOne) greater!!!

### Source of Option.json
```
{
    "~에게" : "사삭이에게"
}
```

"~에게" means "for ~"

# MyHtml Version
Release : [Emergency 1](https://github.com/Tax0787/MyHtml/releases/tag/Emergency1)

# Praise the [`사삭이`](https://github.com/sasak2)
